          <LegalSection title="1. What GoalPulse News Is">
            <p>
              The &ldquo;News&rdquo; section of GoalPulse consists of short
              match reports generated automatically from real, recently
              completed results supplied by our data providers — not
              original reporting from journalists on the ground, press
              releases, or interviews. Each report states the final score,
              competition, and date, and is written from that factual match
              data.
            </p>
          </LegalSection>

          <LegalSection title="2. Why We Do It This Way">
            <p>
              GoalPulse does not operate a newsroom of staff reporters. Being
              upfront about that matters to us: we would rather tell you
              exactly how a report was produced than imply human journalism
              that didn&apos;t happen. Every report is grounded in a real
              completed match — we do not invent fixtures, scores, or quotes.

            <p>
              Match results powering our reports come from{" "}

          <LegalSection title="4. Bylines">
            <p>
              Reports are attributed to &ldquo;GoalPulse Newsroom&rdquo; to
              reflect that they are produced by the GoalPulse platform from
              provider data, rather than by a named individual reporter.
            </p>
          </LegalSection>

          <LegalSection title="5. Accuracy & Corrections">
            <p>
              Because reports are derived directly from provider data, their
              accuracy depends on the accuracy of that source. If you spot a
              score, date, or team name that looks wrong, please tell us —
              we will investigate against the source data and correct or
              remove the report if a genuine error is confirmed.
            </p>
          </LegalSection>

          <LegalSection title="6. No Editorial Bias">
            <p>
              Reports are limited to factual outcomes (who played, the score,
              and the competition) and do not include opinion, punditry, or
              commentary. We do not accept payment for coverage of any team,
              league, or event.
