        question: "What is GoalPulse?",
        answer:
          "GoalPulse is a sports hub for live scores, fixtures, standings, and news across Football, Cricket, Basketball, and Tennis, built on real data from licensed sports data providers.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is GoalPulse free to use?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is GoalPulse affiliated with any league or club?",
        answer:

      {
        question: "Where does the score data come from?",
        answer:
          "Football data comes from Football-Data.org. Cricket, basketball, and tennis data comes from TheSportsDB. See our Data Sources page for a full breakdown.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does football have live scores but cricket, basketball, and tennis don't?",
        answer:
          "Our current access tier with TheSportsDB doesn't include live in-play score updates, so those three sports show recent results and schedules rather than a live scoreboard. Football, via Football-Data.org, does have real live, in-play scores.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often do scores update?",
        answer:
          "Football data refreshes on a 60-second cache and other sports on a 120-second cache, matching what our providers make available — GoalPulse doesn't add artificial delay on top of that.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if a data provider goes down?",
        answer:
          "If Football-Data.org is temporarily unavailable, GoalPulse may show representative fallback data so the interface stays usable rather than breaking outright — this is never shown in place of real live data when the provider is healthy.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use GoalPulse data for betting?",
        answer:
          "No. GoalPulse is for informational and entertainment purposes only and should not be used as the basis for betting or wagering. See our Disclaimer for more.",

      {
        question: "Who writes the News section?",

          "News articles are short match reports generated automatically from real completed results, not original reporting by staff journalists. See our Editorial Policy for full details.",
      },
      {
        question: "I found an error in an article or score — how do I report it?",
        answer:
          "Please contact us with the article or page in question and what looks wrong. We'll check it against the source data and correct or remove it if there's a genuine error.",

        question: "What information does GoalPulse collect about me?",
