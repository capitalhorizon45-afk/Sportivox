            <p>
              By accessing or using GoalPulse (&ldquo;the Service&rdquo;), you
              agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you do not
              agree, please do not use the Service.

          <LegalSection title="2. Description of Service">
            <p>
              GoalPulse provides live sports scores, fixtures, standings, and
              news for Football, Cricket, Basketball, and Tennis, sourced from
              third-party data providers. The Service is provided for
              informational and entertainment purposes only.
            </p>
          </LegalSection>

          <LegalSection title="3. Data Accuracy Disclaimer">
            <p>
              Live scores, fixtures, standings, and statistics are supplied by
              third-party providers (including Football-Data.org and
              TheSportsDB) and may be delayed, incomplete, or occasionally
              incorrect. If a provider is temporarily unavailable, GoalPulse
              may display cached or representative data so the interface
              remains usable, clearly reflecting the underlying provider
              outage rather than presenting it as live. GoalPulse does not
              guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data
              displayed, and this data should not be relied upon for betting,
              wagering, or any purpose requiring guaranteed accuracy.
